### Data Files
Custom MVPs are saved in `customMvps.json` under your Electron `userData`
directory. Edited defaults are stored separately in `mvpDataEdit.json`. Both
files are merged with the base list when the app loads.

## Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Running `npm install` once also sets up `node_modules` so that
`npm test` can execute without module errors.

## Packaging
```bash
npm run make
```

## Testing
Install dependencies if you haven't already and then run Jest:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
If `node_modules` is missing, tests will fail to start.
